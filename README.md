# artnet_image_display
A small utility to display Images in fullscreen and individually control opacity. Useful for controlling logo-projections from a lighting console. 

Use the config.ini to configute ArtNet-Parameters and Paths to image files. The config just has to be in the same folder as the original executable.
A batch file for compilation is part of the repo. But make sure to check if it fits your system - if in doubt, write your own or compile in your preferred way otherwise.

Use and modify this piece of software fully at ur own risk. Its not especially optimized or tested to run completely stable (yet).
